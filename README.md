## SCSS page task:
This task has header and 2 section. The header is fixed and when you hover over the lists inside the header, it grows with the content. I have given it with transform:scale().
In section 2, there are 3 boxes that rotate when hovering over the boxes, and the background image also changes. Section 3 is the usual footer section.
